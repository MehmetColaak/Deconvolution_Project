Deconvolution_Project, is a small fft convolution program for creating impulse response files from reference and recorded sound files.

To use the program:
  - You need to have 2 sound files.(one sine wave sweep, one recording of the sweep in a space)
  - Each sound file has to share same lenght and samplerate.
